## [Unreleased]

## [4.3.0] — 2026-07-31

**One behaviour change to know about before upgrading.** `render_deck.py --gate-check` /
`--deliverables` now require two more `design_plan` fields: **`type_scale`** (`{display, title,
body}` as numbers, tiers that actually rank, body at or above the delivery floor) and
**`signature_proof`** (`{"slide": N, "png": "<rendered png>"}`, the key may also be spelled `path`
as the Codex delivery gate does). Both were gated on the Codex path only, so on the shared path
typography was the one pillar of the visual language nobody had to resolve, and the signature move
was accepted as a sentence with nothing showing it survived the build. Existing `.deck-gates.json`
files will fail until both are filled.

### Added
- **New forms.** `sankey` (flow ribbons, width strictly proportional to value on one deck-wide
  scale), `venn` (2–3 sets; zone labels placed and sized from each region's own geometry),
  `designed_charts.distribution` (box plot at n≥5, mean ± error at n=3–4, every observation
  overlaid, the interval named on the figure — the form for sample data, where a bar of means
  hides n, shape and outliers), `designed_charts.marimekko` (width = segment size, height = its
  split, so cell area is the absolute quantity) and `designed_charts.radar` (3–8 axes, ≤3 series,
  zero-anchored spokes; raises outside those limits).
- **`source_note`** — the per-slide provenance line. `sources_page` defends the deck; this defends
  the slide, which is the unit that actually travels.
- **`scripts/sigs.py`** — one lookup for many helpers: signature, docstring head, and the two
  call-shape contracts that have actually gone wrong. `--example` returns a RUNNABLE call for every
  form component; the smoke suite executes all of them.
- **`design_intent(weight="left"|"right"|"asymmetric")`** — declare a deliberately one-sided
  editorial composition. `LOPSIDED`'s comment had promised this exemption for a long time while its
  code never read intent at all.
- **`--briefing`** density register, for a deck read without a speaker.

### Fixed
- **Grouped decks were never examined.** `lint_deck` walked top-level shapes only, so on a deck
  whose content lives in groups — every designer-tool export, and every deck handed over for
  redesign — it saw one shape per slide: measured, 11 shapes seen ungrouped versus 1 grouped, an
  opaque overlap reported in one and not the other, and every stat derived from the box list
  reading empty while the report printed "✓ clean". The walker now applies the real
  off/ext/chOff/chExt transform through nested groups; a rotated group is refused *out loud*
  rather than guessed. `preflight_check` was blind the same way and worse — a grouped deck escaped
  the whole mechanical subset, including two hard-FAIL checks.
- **Shipped tofu.** `radar`'s own range note used a glyph Helvetica Neue lacks, printing a hollow
  box on every chart with a shared axis range. matplotlib only warns; that warning is now an error
  across all ten recipes, including caller-supplied labels.
- Several first-draft defect classes now fail before the render loop rather than after it:
  non-positive text boxes, literal stride constants in placement loops, mono/full-width residue,
  a bar of sample means, and unsourced numbers.

### Changed
- `check_env.py` probes each candidate save location by actually creating a file — macOS TCC is
  not expressible in permission bits, and `os.access()` reports a directory writable that `open()`
  then refuses.
- `SCALE DRIFT` compares the declared type scale against the type the deck actually sets, and
  refuses to judge from a thin sample of explicitly-sized text.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-07-28

**One behaviour change to know about before upgrading.** `render_deck.py --gate-check` /
`--deliverables` now require a critic waiver to be CLASSIFIED, not merely written. A
`.deck-gates.json` carrying `{"critic": {"waived": "<any string>"}}` used to print one line and
pass; it now needs `waived_category` from a fixed set (`no-dispatch-on-host` /
`already-reviewed-minor-edit` / `user-waived` / `external-deck`), a reason of real substance, and
— for `no-dispatch-on-host` — an explicit `inline_ran` boolean. Existing scripts that waive the
critic will start failing until they say which kind of skip it is. The `verdict: consent` path is
untouched. Why: the Codex delivery gate had required a distinct schema-valid review artifact per
lens for a while, and the shared path accepted any sentence — measured, a hand-typed waiver
carried a whole 10-slide deck through `all hand-off gates pass` with no independent critic ever
involved.

### Added — the checklist now has something that reads it
- **`scripts/preflight_check.py`** decides the mechanical half of PRE-FLIGHT and prints the other
  half as explicitly NOT covered. Eleven of the twelve ticks were self-attested: the model wrote
  twelve checkmarks and nothing anywhere read them, which is the exact silent-skip class the
  checklist exists to prevent. It decides items 1 (speaker-notes coverage), 2 (build timing vs
  `--static`), 3b (every `build:` docstring having matching `Build.step` calls, by AST), 4 (native
  charts + `equation_native`), 7 (an as-of date), 8 (**meta-annotations and unfilled
  `<slot>`/`{slot}` text leaked onto a slide**) and 10 (fonts that may not resolve elsewhere) —
  and prints 5 / 6 / 6b / 9 / 11 as judgment calls that are still yours, so a tick never *looks*
  covered. **Items 2, 7 and 10 are advisory rather than failures by construction**: whether builds
  were opted in, whether any claim is time-bound, and whether a font exists on the *presenter's*
  machine are all facts absent from the file, and a checker that fails on what it cannot know is
  one people learn to ignore. (Item 10 learned this the hard way — it shipped as a failure, and CI
  on Ubuntu promptly declared every macOS-authored deck "not ready to render". `item10_fonts` can
  now return PASS / ADVISORY / NOT CHECKABLE and never FAIL, verified by AST over its own return
  statements and by stubbing the installed-font list empty.)
- **`scripts/check_reference_code.py`** resolves every `deckkit.*` call taught in the skill's own
  prose against the real module — unknown helper, bad keyword, dead `references/*.md` pointer, and
  the silent `.fore_color.alpha = ...` no-op. Prose that teaches an API is still an API contract,
  and nothing used to check it.
- CI now runs both, plus the Codex gate's own 437 lines of tests, which shipped wired to nothing
  (`grep -c codex ci.yml` was 0). Every new step asserts the suite RAN rather than merely exited 0.
- `tests/test_critic_waiver_gate.py` (7 cases) and `tests/test_preflight_check.py` (11 cases). The
  latter asserts both halves: that mechanical defects are caught, and that a clean run still says
  the five judgment items are unticked.

### Fixed — four wrong API facts were shipping in the shared references
- **A scrim recipe that erased the image it was protecting.** Two unfenced shared references taught
  `scrim.fill.fore_color.alpha = int(0.6 * 255)`. python-pptx's `ColorFormat` has no `alpha` setter
  and no `__slots__`, so the assignment raises nothing, writes nothing, and yields a **100% opaque**
  rectangle. Measured on a real deck: the full-bleed cover plate rendered pure black (brightest
  pixel 0/765) and **every lint passed green** — text is painted last so `TEXT NOT VISIBLE` /
  `OCCLUSION` cannot fire, and white-on-pure-black scores ~21:1 so `TEXT-ON-IMAGE CONTRAST` reported
  the best number in the deck. Now `deckkit.scrim_overlay()`, whose gradient carries a real
  `<a:alpha>` on DrawingML's 0–100000 scale (not 0–255, the other half of the original bug).
- `dk.card(...)` — no such helper, and it was the checkmarked "Do" example while the crossed-out
  "Don't" example was the one that actually worked. `icon_tile(tile_color=...)` — the parameter is
  `fill=`. `references/deckkit-component-guide.md` — no such file. `role=content-critic` dispatch —
  appears nowhere in the skill; the real contract is lens-based via `agents/critic.md` +
  `validate_review.py`.
- **`image-generation.md`'s "Planning workflow" list was split in half.** A 90-line section had been
  inserted between steps 2 and 3, orphaning steps 3–6 — including the emphatic "Do NOT pass
  `--count`" rule — under an unrelated heading. Moved verbatim; the list reads 1–6 again.
- `codex-runtime.md` never named `review_effort` / `fast_opt_in` / `thorough_panel` / `arbiters`,
  the keys its own delivery gate enforces — zero matches across every `.md` in the skill. Scoped
  honestly: `review_effort` defaults to `standard`, so a standard-tier run was never blocked, and
  `--init` already emitted most of them. The one real deadlock was `fast`, whose required
  `fast_opt_in` appeared in no doc **and** was missing from the `--init` skeleton. Both closed.
- `build_example_generic.py` promised a spot-check that each `build:` docstring has matching
  `Build.step` calls, while its own `slide_pipeline` docstring declared `build:` and implemented
  none — the example was teaching a docstring that lies.
- `file-inventory.md` was missing three scripts and every test suite. An inventory that omits a
  script is a navigation failure: the model cannot reach for a tool it cannot see.

### Changed
- The Codex / OpenAI adapter now lives on `main` rather than a side branch. One tree serves both
  runtimes, separated by `Codex only:` fences and the `references/runtime-routing.md` profiles
  (`shared` = Claude Code / Kimi; `codex` + `openai-gpt-bridged` = OpenAI). Routing is
  capabilities-first, not provider-inferred. The pre-merge tree is preserved on the `cc_4.1.0`
  branch.
- Local install artifacts (`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `skills-lock.json`, `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`)
  are now ignored; a copy of the skill that drifts from `skills/` should not ship in the repo.

## [4.1.0] — 2026-07-27

**One behaviour change to know about before upgrading.** `render_deck.py --deliverables` now also
refuses on DENSITY — more than a third of slides over the text budget stops the hand-off unless
`.deck-gates.json` carries a written `"density": {"waived": "<reason>"}`. Scripts that call
`--deliverables` on text-heavy decks will start failing. Two escapes, both intended: pass the
delivery mode (`--selfread` / `--textheavy` / `--surface`, the same flags `lint_deck.py` takes) so
the deck is held to its own budget, or record the waiver. Everything else below is additive.

### Added — the render decides, not a list of shape types
- **`TEXT NOT VISIBLE`** asks the one question with a bounded answer — does this line render any
  glyphs at all? — straight from the pixels. Every previous occlusion rule enumerated *causes* (this
  shape type, painted then, covering that much), and causes are unbounded: pictures were skipped
  because alpha is unknowable from the file, groups and gradients for their own reasons, and anything
  assembled from many small parts slipped a per-shape threshold. Three real decks shipped through
  those holes with the gate reporting clean.
- **`OCCLUSION` / `RULE THROUGH TEXT` now measure the UNION** of everything painted over a text
  block, so a 150-tile field erasing a caption and a rule assembled from 40 dashes are caught like
  the single shapes they look like.
- **`CAPTION NOT ALIGNED`** — a label must sit on the thing it labels. The panels of a composite
  figure have no shape geometry, so captions get laid out on the text grid while the panels sit
  where the plotting library put them, at widths that differ whenever the panels keep their own
  aspect ratios. Read out of the pixels, so it works whether the panels are one composite or a row
  of separate pictures. Ground is estimated per figure crop, not from the page, because a 4% grey
  step between a figure's own paper and the page was enough to make the check disqualify itself.
- **A skipped check is audible.** With no renders beside the deck the pixel-backed families disable
  themselves and the run says so (`[skipped] … NOT checked: …`, plus `pixel_checks` in `--json`).
  `0 findings` with that line present is a different sentence from `0 findings` without it.
- **A CRASHED check is audible too.** The per-slide statistics were wrapped in
  `except Exception: pass`; one refactor took TEXT WALL, LAYOUT SAMENESS, UNDERFILLED, FLAT RHYTHM
  and the body-size floor off every deck while the report still printed `✓ clean`. It now prints
  `[BROKEN] … NOT checked: …` and the suite asserts that line is absent on every fixture deck.

### Added — hand-off gates that do not depend on what the user feels like accepting
- **DENSITY** (above). Calibrated against the skill's own reference deck, which runs at a median of
  **27 words a slide** — the budget was never the problem. It exists because the per-slide `TEXT
  WALL` warning was correct and ignored on two consecutive decks (8/12, then 12/12 over budget).
- **`render_deck.py <deck>.pptx --gate-check`** runs every hand-off gate, renders nothing, finishes
  in under a second. The gates used to be reachable only through `--deliverables`, which Step 6
  deliberately makes a *decline-able offer* — so on every deck where the user said "no PDF", the
  strongest gate in the skill never ran, and nothing showed that it hadn't.
- The design checkpoint now carries a **`density:` line as two numbers** the gate can be compared
  against (planned median load, planned count over 70), so density is decided at plan time instead
  of discovered at lint time.

### Fixed — the measurement everything else is built on
- **Bold text in font COLLECTIONS (.ttc/.otc) measured at regular width**, 3.9% short. Every guard
  built on `measure_text` silently passed while the text wrapped anyway: a caption sized for one
  line put its second on top of a footer, and the lint agreed with the build because both were
  computed from the same wrong number. Fixed by selecting the right face index inside the
  collection — and CI now **renders real strings and compares the ink against the prediction**,
  one-sided: the measurement may be conservative, never optimistic.

### Changed
- **The critic's second round is scoped, and the cost is published.** Round 2 was a full fresh
  whole-deck re-review; the measured A/B is in `references/critic-panel.md` — including a claim from
  an earlier draft that the measurement did not support and that was removed rather than softened.
- **A third-party assessment does not wear its subject's livery.** The LOGO PRINCIPLE situation
  table gained the row for decks that evaluate an entity rather than speak for one.
- **SEARCH BUDGET.** Web search is capped per SESSION and shared with every subagent; one research
  fan-out (12 agents + 7 verifiers, none told a cap existed) spent all 200, and the bill arrived
  hours later when a single lookup for a company's official logo could not run. Small NAMED lookups
  go first, each dispatch states a per-agent cap, the round stays under half of what REMAINS (not
  half the cap — the budget does not reset between decks), and `searches: planned/spent` reaches the
  hand-off `cost:` line. Stated where the fan-out is DISPATCHED, not 1000 lines later.

### CI / repository
- The credential scanner was excluded from the repo by the very pattern it scans for (`*_secret*`);
  `check_repo_integrity.py` now fails the build on any ignored source file or untracked CI path.
- The regression suite ran ABOVE `pip install`, so every run died on a bare `ModuleNotFoundError`
  that reads exactly like a lint regression. Moved after the installs, with an audible-skip backstop
  so a silently skipped suite cannot pass.
- Both READMEs realigned with the shipped skill.

### Verification
22 regression assertions (from 18), two-sided: a PASS corpus that must stay clean, a FAIL corpus
where every defect must be caught, and the skill's own reference deck held at baseline. The lint
changes in this release were then attacked by an adversarial audit that required a runnable repro
for every claim — 20 raised, 5 confirmed, all 5 fixed here, including two claims in earlier commit
messages that the audit proved false.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-07-26

**Why a major bump.** `render_deck.py --deliverables` now REFUSES to run until the deck carries a
`.deck-gates.json` recording that its quality gates actually ran. Anything scripting `--deliverables`
breaks until it writes that file (or a written waiver). That is the breaking change; everything else
below is additive.

### Added — review effort is a tier the user picks, not one the skill infers
- The rule that scales the loop ("scale the critic to stakes") always existed but was never offered.
  Measured on one low-stakes deck: **~32 subagents and ~2M tokens** across research + build + two
  review rounds, with the user given no visibility and no choice. Step 0 now collects a one-word
  **`review:` tier** — `fast` | `standard` | `thorough` — sizing BOTH cost centres, the research
  fan-out and the review panel (they measured comparable: ~1.02M tokens of research against ~0.95M
  of review).
- **`standard` and `thorough` are pure ALIASES** for the low-stakes and high-stakes behaviour that
  already existed — every cell of the tier table either restates the stakes section or defers to it.
  **A deck whose user says nothing behaves exactly as before.** `fast` is the one genuinely new band
  and is **opt-in only, never derived**: one generalist critic and one round is a real recall drop,
  so it has to be asked for. Purpose decides the tier; SIZE never lowers it.
- Floors no tier may move: the build-time geometry gate, the render lint, PRE-FLIGHT 12, at least one
  independent critic, the EXISTENCE of the primary-source gate, and `.deck-gates.json`. Per-section
  panels on large decks and corroborated consent on high-stakes decks are shapes, not weight, and are
  unaffected by the tier. `fast` may not silently ship over a `revise` — it returns to the user.
- The hand-off now carries `review:` and `cost:` lines. A dial whose bill is never shown builds no
  intuition, so the next deck's choice is as blind as the last one's.
- **Pass the approved claim ledger to critics WHOLE, never a summary retyped for the dispatch.** The
  largest measured saving here: 7 of 8 "unsourced" findings in one round-2 review were briefing
  artifacts, and the round they consumed was pure waste.
- An earlier draft was rejected by a six-dimension adversarial audit (9 blockers, 27 majors) and
  largely rewritten. Two invented optimisations were **dropped rather than patched** — "triggered
  arbitration" at `standard` (it contradicted four surviving statements that low-stakes dispatches no
  arbiter, including `agents/arbiter.md`'s own brief) and narrowing round 2 to the changed slides (the
  review-validation gate's scope buckets are whole-deck and per-section only, so a scoped round 2
  bounces and costs an extra round). Both are recorded in `critic-panel.md` as deliberate reversions
  with their reasons.

### Added — the hand-off gate, and a consent record that is evidence rather than a claim
- `--deliverables` refuses without `.deck-gates.json`: a critic verdict, the design plan's
  `boldness` / `signature_move` / `carried_by` / `form_ledger`, and the provenance pass's **per-claim**
  `claims` list (a summary tally is rejected on purpose — a tally is written by the same pass that
  would have skipped the refutation). Any gate deliberately skipped is **waived in writing**, and the
  tool prints the reason, so a skip is visible instead of invisible.
- `validate_review.py --record <deck-dir>` writes the `critic` block **from the validated review
  itself** — verdict, blocker/major counts, the review file's path and sha256 — and `--deliverables`
  re-reads that artifact. A record the model types at hand-off is self-certification: the model that
  skipped the loop writes the same JSON as the model that ran it. Verified by execution across five
  adversarial paths (review edited after recording → sha256 mismatch; file moved; record says consent
  while the review says revise → "the artifact wins"; a review consenting with a blocker still open;
  hand-written record with no source → still passes, labelled `SELF-REPORTED`). Backward compatible by
  design: the old shape is not broken, it is made distinguishable.

### Security — credentials are scanned by SHAPE, and the recurring `sk-*` false positive is documented
- A third-party multi-engine scan reported a possible hardcoded `sk-` API key. Audited the full tree
  and the **full history (1,645 blobs, all refs)**: **no credential exposure and nothing to revoke.**
  Every hit is a CSS class name — the direction-gate preview names its classes after slide skeletons
  (`sk-body`, `sk-split`, `sk-island`, `sk-band`, `sk-rail`, `sk-statement`), and `sk-` is short for
  *skeleton*. A real key is `sk-` + ~48 high-entropy characters; these are `sk-` + four to nine
  lowercase letters.
- This was the second time that report had been filed and dismissed by hand (v3.9.0 was the first).
  The false positive is not the expensive part — **a report that is always wrong teaches everyone to
  ignore the scanner, and then the one true positive is ignored too.** So the dismissal is now a
  command: `scripts/scan_secrets.py` discriminates by minimum length AND a Shannon-entropy floor
  rather than by prefix, covering OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub classic + fine-grained, AWS, GCP, Slack,
  private-key blocks and generic `secret = "..."` assignments. It never prints a matched value —
  only its location and a masked head — because a scanner that echoes what it found has published it
  into your CI logs.
- It **self-tests both directions before it scans** (real shapes must be caught, this repo's own
  strings must not be), so a rule that silently stops matching fails the build instead of reporting
  clean. Wired into CI on every push and PR: selftest → working tree → every blob in every commit
  (a key deleted in a later commit is still leaked, so the tree alone is not an answer).
- `.gitignore` now covers `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `id_rsa*`, `*_secret*` and
  `credentials.json` — staying out of version control becomes a mechanism rather than a habit.
  `image-generation.md` no longer shows any literal after `OPENAI_API_KEY=`; the documented pattern
  reads from a local key file, because a scanner cannot tell a placeholder from a credential and
  neither can a reader skimming a diff. New `SECURITY.md` records the audit and the ten-second check.

### Added — a CI guard that a SKILL.md slimming layers content instead of deleting it
- `scripts/check_skill_lossless.py` + a CI step prove every substantive line of a baseline SKILL.md is
  still findable somewhere in the skill tree after a refactor. Deliberate deletions go in an allowlist
  keyed on a hash of the normalised line, so editing a line revokes its waiver.

### Changed — SKILL.md layered into step-scoped references (228KB → 134KB), losslessly
- Working detail moved into eight new step-scoped reference files, each with a live trigger at the
  pipeline moment that needs it. **Two files were deliberately pulled BACK inline** — the deckkit
  component catalogue and the render self-check — because their absence makes no noise: no lint fires
  when you hand-roll a form the library already has or skip the scan entirely, so a rule whose omission
  is silent cannot live behind a read. Verified 2298/2298 lines accounted for.

### Fixed — `native_chart(value_fmt=...)` now rejects the wrong format dialect
- `value_fmt` is written straight into the chart's EXCEL number-format code, while `iso_bars` takes the
  Python dialect, and neither docstring said so — a `{:,.0f}` handed to `native_chart` was printed raw
  onto a shipped slide. It now raises a named `ValueError`. Pre-existing, unrelated to the refactor.

### Added — `TITLE-RULE MONOCULTURE` lint (the title-chrome rotation rule is now GATED, not prose-only)
- The render self-check has long said "the title CHROME is not one fixed template repeated on every
  slide — rotate 2-3 treatments", but it lived only in prose and got missed (a `head()`-style build
  helper that stamps one eyebrow+rule on all 12 content slides is exactly how it regresses; a critic
  pass didn't catch it either). `scripts/lint_deck.py` now detects it deterministically: a per-slide
  `title_rule_y` feature + a deck-level check that fires **`TITLE-RULE MONOCULTURE`** when the same thin
  rule sits under the title at the same height on >60% of content slides (rules must CLUSTER at one
  height, so a deck that rotates rule/tab/rail/ordinal never trips it; filled eyebrow tabs and vertical
  accent rails are excluded by geometry). Mirrors the existing `BOTTOM-STRIP MONOCULTURE` gate. SKILL.md
  render self-check "Titles" now references the backstop. Verified: fires 10/10 on an all-rule deck,
  clean on a rotated one.

## [3.9.0] — 2026-07-22

### Security — hardened a docs API-key placeholder (no real key was ever present)
- A multi-engine scan flagged a hardcoded `sk-` API key. Investigation confirmed **no credential
  exposure**: the scripts read the key from an env var (`os.environ.get(...)`), no `.env`/secret files
  are tracked, and git history carries no real key (nothing to revoke). The single hit was a docs
  placeholder — `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."` in `references/image-generation.md` — which a scanner
  can misread as a truncated key. Replaced it with the safer file/secret-manager pattern the FAQ already
  recommends (`$(cat ~/.openai_key)`) plus an obvious `DUMMY_KEY_replace_at_runtime` fallback and a
  never-hard-code comment. Re-scan clean (the only remaining `sk-` strings are CSS skeleton class names).

### Fixed — bold BESPOKE design is first-class again (the preset gate was a launchpad, not a menu)
- A strict two-front audit (integration + bold-design) of the preset-driven gate found the gate
  *framing* had quietly demoted agent-invented styles: bespoke was licensed "only for a topic no
  preset fits" (an escape hatch), the phrase "REAL STYLES, not synthesised colour schemes" falsely
  equated *synthesised* with *colours-only*, and nothing at the gate said a picked preset is a **floor
  to beat, not a destination**. The downstream boldness/signature-move machinery was fully intact
  (structurally the skill couldn't ship a template-with-extra-steps deck) — but the gate pointed the
  wrong way. Reframed across `SKILL.md` + `references/collaborative-mode.md`: presets are the FLOOR you
  beat; a bespoke register invented for THIS content (its own motif + palette + type + guard + all-pages
  carry) is a **first-class peer**, *preferred* when the content has a visual world of its own; and the
  gate now reconnects to the signature-move gate — "picked a preset → rendered the preset" does NOT
  discharge the design step.
- **Bespoke registers now render their OWN real DNA in the preview**, so the claim above is true rather
  than aspirational: a direction dict may carry `cover_motif` + `ambient_motif` HTML (its loud hero
  motif + quiet interior echo), which `_dna_cover`/`_dna_ambient` render verbatim — a first-class peer
  of a named preset, not a motif-less colourway. Verified end-to-end (a bespoke "Sonar" register: ping
  rings on the cover, a quiet ring echo on every interior slide). New `smoke_directions` regression.

### Fixed — self-verify (q) is now actually ENFORCED (it pointed at hooks that didn't exist)
- The integration audit found new item (q) ("style runs through every slide") named a critic check and
  a plan field that were both fictional, so the "只有首尾页" failure could still ship uncaught. Wired it
  for real: a **`interior register:` contract-card field** (`agents/critic.md`), a **`register_interiors`
  Lens-B check** (`critic.md` schema + `references/review-rubrics.md`), and a **PRE-FLIGHT tick (6b)**
  (`SKILL.md`). A style dressed only on the bookends, with no `none — <reason>` carve, is now a finding.
- **Resolved (q)'s conflict with the motif-dosing gates.** (q) prescribes a per-slide corner mark / edge
  rule / grid — the exact devices the chrome-budget rule, PRE-FLIGHT 6, and the critic's stamping check
  flag as findings. Added the governing distinction everywhere: a **quiet register signature** (faint,
  meaning-free, chrome-level) is part of the *repeating design SYSTEM* and is welcome on every slide;
  "never per-slide stamping" bites only the **loud signature motif** (the dosed 2–3-appearance daring
  device). Propagated to `slide-design.md`, `SKILL.md` PRE-FLIGHT 6, `critic.md`, `review-rubrics.md`.
- **Comprehensive integration verification** (a 12-agent workflow — 5 dimension finders → adversarial
  refute-each-finding → synthesis) returned **pass**: runtime, design-capability, and cross-references
  all verified clean after four low-severity seams were fixed — the `midcentury`/`synthwave` preset
  guards were carved to sanction the quiet every-slide register (they read "not per slide"), the
  contract-card assembly list now echoes the `interior register:` field the critic reads, and two stale
  doc/comment references were corrected.

### Added — the chosen style now runs through EVERY slide, not just the cover (的风格要走所有页)
- A user reported a style that "只有首尾页" — lived only on the first/last page. Root cause: the
  direction-gate preview rendered each preset's DNA on the **cover only**; interior archetype slides
  carried palette+type but no motif. **`archetypes_html._dna_ambient()`** now renders a quiet
  **ambient register signature** (a corner mark, edge rule, faint grid/scanline, recurring numeral/
  seal — the dialed-down echo of the cover's hero motif) on **every** interior preview slide, at
  z-index:0 behind the content (interior blocks lifted to z-index:1 so nothing is covered). Verified
  legible across all 18 presets, light and dark.
- **`agents/slide-design.md` self-verify gains item (q)** — the built deck's motif register must have
  a quiet, legible home on interior slides too (stronger than "palette/type repeat"): a deck whose
  style lives only on the bookends FAILS the design checkpoint. Restraint, not repetition-of-the-hero
  (a loud motif stamped on every slide fails the block-sameness gate). Wires the fix into a gate, per
  the enforcement invariant.

### Changed — direction-gate count is now branch-aware (no image tool → 4; with image tool → 3)
- On the **no-image-tool / "design a clean one"** branch the gate now offers **4** rendered
  directions: the 3 best-fit DNA presets **+ 1 pure colour-scheme direction** (a tasteful palette+type
  combo with no motif — the classic clean look, itself a legitimate style the user asked to keep on
  the menu). The **with-image-tool** branch (generated-template style gate) stays at **3**.
- **`preset_directions()`** now accepts a **dict** in its list (passed through verbatim as a no-`dna`
  colour direction), so all four build in one call: `preset_directions(["p1","p2","p3", {colour}])`.
- **`build_directions_html()`** auto-letters the "describe your own" slot to the position AFTER the
  rendered directions — **D** on a 3-up gate, **E** on the 4-up gate — fixing a latent collision where
  a 4th rendered direction and the hardcoded describe-your-own were both "D". SKILL.md gate-line
  grammar updated to `picked A/B/C/D/E of 4`; collaborative-mode Gate A "how many" rule rewritten.

### Changed — generated imagery must FUSE the style AND stay topical (both, not either)
- New 🔴 **FUSION gate** in `references/generated-template.md`: every generated hero/divider/plate must
  be BOTH unmistakably on-style (the register named at the style gate) AND depict THIS deck's subject
  (a stranger could name the topic from the picture) — a beautifully on-style but topically generic
  image (abstract mesh, stock swoosh) now explicitly **fails** and is regenerated with the deck's own
  subject motifs folded in (the REFERENT RULE).

### Changed — the direction gate is now PRESET-DRIVEN (real styles, not colour schemes)
- The 3 directions shown at Gate A are now the **3 best-fit named presets** rendered with their own
  **DNA**, not three synthesised palette/font combos. A user reported the old gate "只是不同的颜色搭配"
  (just different colour pairings) — true: it varied palette + fonts + composition but carried no
  register motif, so Swiss and Bauhaus looked like the same slide in two colourways.
- **`archetypes_html.preset_directions([names])`** — new bridge that converts preset names into
  direction tokens carrying a `dna` marker; **`_dna_cover()`** renders each preset's signature motif
  as an HTML overlay on the cover preview (Swiss ghost-numeral `01`, Ink-wash `印` seal, Memphis
  scattered dots, Blueprint grid/nodes, Bauhaus primitive triad, Midcentury starburst/atom, Terminal
  scanlines + `> _` prompt, Synthwave perspective-grid horizon + banded sunset). The gate now proves
  the style, so a pick is a pick between *languages*, not hues.
- **SKILL.md** direction-gate section + **collaborative-mode.md** Gate A rewritten to preset-driven
  default: recommend the best-fit real presets, build tokens with `preset_directions`, render one HTML
  preview, let the user pick A/B/C/D. `smoke_directions` gains a regression asserting the tokens carry
  DNA (motif renders; a plain non-preset direction stays empty).

### Added — 4 new native style presets (18 total; all code-only, no generated image)
- **`bauhaus`** — modernist geometric: primary red/yellow/blue on off-white, ONE oversized primitive
  (circle/square/triangle) as the hero shape, lowercase geometric sans. Guarded to the primary triad.
- **`midcentury`** — warm retro (Eames-era): harvest palette (mustard/avocado/burnt-orange/teal on
  cream), atomic/starburst/boomerang motifs, geometric-humanist type.
- **`terminal`** — CLI / phosphor CRT: monospace throughout, phosphor-green (or amber) on near-black,
  scanlines, `>`/`$` prompt bullets. For developer-tool / infra / hacker-CTF / release-notes decks.
- **`synthwave`** — retro-future neon: neon magenta/cyan on indigo-black, a receding perspective-grid
  horizon + banded sunset, glow chrome. For launch / gaming / music-culture registers.
- Each carries full schema parity with the mature presets (`guard` register-floor, `when` selection
  hint, `image_prompt`), so they are wired for the whole pipeline — designer selection, builder guard
  enforcement, critic register check, and the direction gate — not just the preview. Added to the
  `design-gallery.md` catalogue with when-to-use. Preset set chosen from a web-research sweep of design
  movements; neubrutalism / Art-Deco / De-Stijl / vaporwave were rejected as re-skins of existing
  presets or house-taste conflicts.

## [3.8.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added — native 2.5D isometric components (no generated image)
- **`deckkit.iso_bars`** — a **faithful** 2.5D bar chart: extrusion height is linear in the value and
  zero-based, so the depth never distorts the data (this is why the projection is parallel, not
  perspective — a perspective chart would foreshorten the far bars and lie). Rejects negatives and
  >9 bars with an actionable message; `highlight=` pops one bar in `hi_color=` (default the deck's
  emphasis hue).
- **`deckkit.iso_stack`** — a layered architecture / disclosure ladder / decision hierarchy: floating
  isometric slabs with a label aligned beside each. Caps at ~6 layers (raises, like `org_tree`).
- **`deckkit.iso_prism`** — one extruded isometric block as a hero; returns a **cleared apex** anchor
  above the whole top face so a caller can seat a label without landing it on the rhombus.
- Fixed projection (true 30° isometric) and one-light-source face shading (top = base, right ×0.80,
  left ×0.55) so every 2.5D element in a deck reads as one system. Text sits **beside** the geometry —
  python-pptx cannot shear text onto a tilted face. **Scenario gates** live in `form-selection.md`:
  2.5D trades **precision for presence** (the constant top-face pedestal compresses ratios, an 8×
  reads ~4.8×), so it is a pitch/launch/keynote move, never a research/defense results comparison, and
  the more the room rewards rigor the worse the trade. Dose like generated imagery — one 2.5D moment
  per deck. Complementary to the generated-image branch: native = crisp, editable, data-bearing;
  generated = soft, organic, atmospheric.

### Added — `component_audit.py`: did this deck hand-roll a form the library implements?
- Reads the build script (which components were called, via `dk.x()`, an alias, or
  `from deckkit import x`) + the finished pptx (geometry signatures: bar row · abutting 100% band ·
  tile row · marker row) and names the component whose geometry a hand-roll matches. **Advisory,
  never a blocker** — a bespoke composition is the *signature move*; what the tool states as fact is
  the usage ratio and the specific match. **Motivation, measured:** across three delivered decks the
  build scripts called 3 of 59 form components; everything else was raw box+text, re-inheriting the
  geometry bugs the components fix. Run at PRE-FLIGHT 12.
- Suppression is **derived from deckkit's source** (which functions draw rects) intersected with the
  form catalogue — a hand-kept list was wrong twice in two edits (`columns()` returns rects and draws
  nothing; `table()` emits a GraphicFrame), each time silencing real detections deck-wide. A
  deck that was never opened now prints `NOT CHECKED` and exits 1 rather than reporting clean.

### Added — deck-level gates: RULE_THROUGH_TEXT · composition axis · signature proof
- **`RULE_THROUGH_TEXT`** (build-time lint CRITICAL) — a decorative rule/divider drawn *through* a
  text block's ink, always caused by a hand-picked `y` the text later grew into. Neither existing
  lint caught it (a thin box over text is not text-on-text, not overflow, not invisible text); it
  shipped twice in one delivered deck and was caught by the user. Derive the rule from the block's
  measured end, never a coordinate.
- **The direction gate diverges on COMPOSITION, not just palette** — the token set gained `cover`
  and `skeleton` (rendered faithfully to the canonical skeleton vocabulary), divergence is now a
  pairwise `≥2 of {palette · type · density · composition}` rule with lock-and-redirect, and a new
  `directions_diversity.py` measures it (never auto-kills — rediverge or justify on the gate line).
  The picked composition is **carried into the built deck** (the `cover` token becomes the cover's
  layout, `skeleton` becomes the rhythm map's plurality), not discarded at `style.py`.
- **The SIGNATURE PROOF opens Step 4** — author the signature slide first and render just that page
  (`render_deck.py --slides N`) before authoring the rest, so the pixels that honour or sand the
  `boldness:`/`signature move:` contract arrive when the decision is cheap to change, not after the
  whole deck is built. `signature move:` now carries a `carried_by:` clause (2–3 slides where the
  idea does structural work), verified through to the critic.

### Changed — blandness can block, at the user's own dial
- The critic's distinctiveness axis was MAJOR-at-most (a deck asked to be **bold** could ship
  forgettable with a footnote while a 4pt overflow blocked). At `boldness: bold`/`experimental` a
  surviving *timid*/*sanded* verdict is now blocking-until-**the user** waives it — the waiver moves
  from the agent to the person who set the dial. `conservative`/`balanced+` unchanged.

### Fixed
- **`render_deck.py --slides N[,M]`** renders only the named pages (the signature-proof path);
  byte-identical to those pages from a full render, leaves no cache, mutually exclusive with `--fast`
  and `--deliverables`.
- **`lint_deck.py` is iso-aware** — two textless freeform polygons that overlap are the faces of one
  vector drawing (an iso solid, any freeform illustration), not a card collision; a pure-2.5D slide
  no longer drowns the linter in self-overlap noise. A text card on a prism still flags.
- A long chain of self-inflicted defects found by adversarial review across these features — an
  over-suppressing audit list, a green pre-flight for an unopened deck, a composition axis that
  stopped at the preview, an iso_prism return that produced invisible labels, iso_stack labels
  drifting into the trough beside the next slab — each fixed and locked with a regression.
- **Whole-skill maturity audit (six lenses, adversarially verified)** closed the last integration
  gaps from the recent gate additions: a composition `skeleton` token that could **crash the
  direction gate** (a 5-value hard-error set feeding an 8-value rhythm-map vocabulary — now accepts
  all eight); a **dead rule** where the composition tokens were produced and routed to the design
  lens but the critic brief never consumed them (now wired producer→consumer→arbiter with a verdict
  slot); and reference drift behind the code (small_multiples told the agent to hand-compose what its
  own index forbids; the design-gallery catalogue omitted four real components; `modbox` had no
  when-to-use trigger). Plus disambiguation tie-breakers (`hub_spoke`/`hub_spokes`, `scorecard`/
  `kpi_card`) and every emitted lint code now documented.

## [3.7.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added — design components the form catalogue kept prescribing and could not draw
- **`deckkit.small_multiples`** — a grid of identical mini native charts on ONE SHARED value axis,
  with an optional hero panel. The cheapest correctness win in the set: `data-viz.md` and
  `form-selection.md` both prescribe shared scales, but composing `native_chart` per panel by hand
  let PowerPoint auto-scale each one, so **a small bump and a huge bump rendered identically** — a
  silent misreading no geometry lint could see. The regression asserts the axis contract itself.
- **`deckkit.position_map`** — N labelled items on two continuous axes, with greedy label
  anti-collision and a `ValueError` naming any pair it cannot separate. `quadrant()` returns four
  cells and discards the within-cell position that is usually the whole argument; `native_bubble`
  drops the labels.
- **`deckkit.annotated_figure`** — a real figure + numbered fractional-coordinate markers + a
  numbered caption rail + an optional magnified inset (via `Picture.crop_*`, no image processing).
  The inset picks the first corner that covers no marker. This is the form the skill's own
  integral-figure philosophy most insists on and least supported.
- **`deckkit.org_tree`** — tidy hierarchy layout: post-order centroid placement (the part that stops
  being hand-placeable at depth 3), horizontal bus connectors, and a hard `ValueError` when it cannot
  fit legibly rather than silently squeezing.
- **`image_fx.quiet_region(path)`** — grid luminance-variance scan returning the image's calmest
  **single-ink** region plus its mean luminance, so title placement and ink colour are measured
  rather than eyeballed. Two fixes found by running it on real photographs: the growth threshold
  anchors on the image's own variance distribution (one flat cell otherwise made every gradient
  neighbour look "busy"), and growth requires luminance coherence — a full-height column spanning
  dark sky and light ground averages to a mid-luminance where *neither* ink is safe.
- **`deckkit.design_intent(slide, envelope=, rhyme=, reason=)`** — the declared-register channel that
  three lint messages already promised ("record the quiet-register exception") with nowhere to record
  it. Stored as an invisible zero-ink tag shape, so intent travels **inside the .pptx** to the
  render-time lint with no side-channel file. Abuse is audited (`INTENT INFLATION`).
- **`deckkit.pic_alpha(picture, pct)`** — native picture opacity via `a:alphaModFix`. Against the
  scrim-overlay approach the A/B is unambiguous: the image keeps its own hues instead of being tinted
  toward the scrim colour, and there is no second full-bleed shape.

### Added — `--fast` incremental render
- **`render_deck.py --fast` re-renders only the slides that changed.** Profiling an 18-slide deck:
  build 1.8s, LibreOffice→PDF 9.1s, rasterize 24.4s cold. Rasterization, not the PDF export, is the
  larger cost. Measured: **12.3s → 4.7s** for a one-slide change, **0.07s** when nothing changed;
  outputs byte-identical to a full render.
- Each slide is fingerprinted (its XML + rels + the bytes of the media it references) and mixed with
  a **deck-global digest** (presentation.xml, theme, masters, layouts). That digest closes a hole
  found by testing: flipping the canvas 16:9→4:3 changes no slide XML, so `--fast` previously
  reported "no slide changed" and left every PNG at the wrong aspect ratio.
- **Correctness over speed throughout** — a stale PNG is worse than a slow render, because the lint
  and the visual critic both trust `render/*.png` to BE the deck. Full-render fallbacks (each with a
  printed reason) for: changed slide count, hidden slides, auto slide-number fields, or no cache.
  Cache writes are atomic and **delete the cache on failure**.
- Hardened against an adversarial audit (27 candidates → 5 must-fix, all reproduced): hidden slides
  broke the page↔slide mapping on the pre-existing full path too; an unresolvable part hashed to a
  constant so real edits stopped registering; the subset PDF collided between concurrent runs;
  `--fast --deliverables` exited 0 having produced no PDF (now rejected at parse time); and media
  owned by a layout/master/theme was invisible to the digest.

### Added — deck-level design gates (the second design-capability tranche)
- **`ENVELOPE MONOCULTURE`** — fires when >60% of interior slides end their content at the same
  height. A deck can vary every form and still read as one template because every page fills the
  same rectangle; this is judged as a *distribution*, not per slide.
- **`REGISTRATION DRIFT`** — consecutive title tops drifting 0.02–0.12in. Identical is calm and a
  deliberate jump is a decision; a sub-visible wobble is neither, and reads as a twitch when
  advancing.
- **`INHERITED_EFFECT`** — warns when a shape bypasses the theme-shadow strip (below).
- **`DEAD BOTTOM`**'s per-slide floor drops 0.62 → 0.45, so only the genuine accident fires; the
  0.45–0.62 band is a legitimate upper envelope and is now judged by the distribution check instead.

### Changed — `OLDSTYLE_FIGURES` is a WARN; the defect is prevented in the components
- **v3.6.0 shipped this as a hard build blocker. It is now a WARN**, and the defect is prevented at
  the source instead: `numeral_run_face()` resolves a lining face inside every component that emits a
  figure, so correct output is the default rather than a rule authors must satisfy.
- **Why the architecture changed rather than the threshold:** a fourth audit round found *more*
  defects than the third (12 non-minor vs 5), three self-inflicted by the previous fix round. As a
  blocker the rule has an unbounded false-positive surface — every component × every font × every
  string shape — while being structurally blind to where numbers most often live: tables and native
  charts report `has_text_frame=False`, so their numeric cells and tick labels were never checked at
  all. `"7"` (a single digit, which cannot bob), `"10x"` and `"H1 2026"` were blocked; a cover whose
  title IS a year had no fix available to its author.
- A project that wants it fatal asserts over its own finished file — which is what a build script can
  now do in three lines.

### Changed — numeral faces resolve from the deck's design (visible change)
- **`big_numeral`'s default face changed.** It was hard-coded `serif="Georgia"`; it now resolves
  through `deckkit.numeral_face()`, which keeps a lining SERIF (Times New Roman) by default. The
  register is preserved — an oversized italic serif figure, as before — but the digits no longer
  sit at mixed heights. **A deck rebuilt from an older build script will render its marker numerals
  in a different face.** `serif=` still overrides, except that an old-style face is substituted
  (lint_layout would reject it).
- `stat_row`, `scorecard`, `kpi_card` and `change_stat` route their FIGURE runs through the same
  resolver, keeping each component's own default (body font) while guaranteeing lining digits.
  Previously these inherited a body/display face and could hard-fail their own output on a deck
  whose font is Georgia.
- Which faces count as old-style is **measured from the installed font** rather than read off a
  list; the curated set is only a fallback for fonts the machine does not have.

### Changed — the PDF and viewer.html are reserved hand-off deliverables
- They were produced on **every** render and parked at the deck root. A deck is rebuilt each critic
  round and then usually hand-edited in PowerPoint, so both went stale the moment the .pptx changed —
  and **a stale PDF is worse than an absent one**, because someone opens it and reviews the wrong deck.
- `render_deck.py` now takes **`--deliverables`** (alias `--final`), off by default. The PDF still
  exists as a render intermediate inside `render/`; the flag is what promotes it to the deck root and
  writes the viewer. The default run prints a one-line reminder of how to produce them at hand-off.
  `--fast` and `--deliverables` are mutually exclusive, enforced at flag-parse time.

### Security — the metered image rung asks before it bills
- The generated-template branch had three rungs (native imagegen → codex CLI → `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  governed by one rule: *never block on a choice when a working path is present*. Right for the two
  subscription rungs, **wrong for the third** — it treats a present API key as authorisation. On a
  machine with no codex CLI but an exported key, the skill would have started billing per image
  without asking.
- **BILLING GATE:** rung 3 is metered, an available key is NOT consent, ask before the first paid
  call — a red stop **explicitly not waived** by a per-deck auto directive (delegation covers
  preferences, never the user's money) — and on a decline fall back to a native look rather than
  spending. `agents/asset-prep.md` (a subagent brief, which could have spent money with no way to
  ask) and `generate_images_codex.py`'s own failure message are corrected to match.
- **Claude Code's real cost is now documented:** CC has no native image tool, so the codex CLI IS the
  path there — free on the subscription, one `codex login`. Q1 probes for a free path *before*
  offering the branch, so a user cannot pick a look nothing can generate.

### Fixed — the inherited theme shadow under every generated shape
- python-pptx stamps `<p:style><a:effectRef idx="2">` on every autoshape, connector and freeform,
  resolving to the theme's soft drop shadow. `shadow.inherit = False` writes an empty `<a:effectLst/>`
  into `spPr` — **PowerPoint honours that, LibreOffice does not**, and LibreOffice is what the render
  loop and the visual critic look at.
- Measured under a plain box: a ~10px grey gradient (185,185,185 → white) under every card, chip,
  callout, tile, node and device frame **in every deck this skill has ever produced**. It is the
  single artifact that most separates "2010 SmartArt" from flat editorial, and no author could have
  seen it — the XML says there is no shadow. (It also explains an earlier round spent warming a
  frosted tint because panels "read cool grey": the grey was largely this.)
- `_flat()` removes the element at all 20 shape-creation sites. Deliberate shadows are unaffected
  (`offset_shadow`, `glass_card`).

### Fixed — a failed render reported as SUCCESS, and four lint false positives
- **CRITICAL:** `_render_pdf` returned the *expected* path and `main` only checked
  `os.path.isfile()`, never `returncode`. With `out` == the deck folder (where a `--deliverables` PDF
  legitimately lives) a **stale file satisfied that check**: the run printed "rendered N slides",
  exited 0, left the old PNGs, and wrote fresh fingerprints — so the next `--fast` said "no slide
  changed" and the stale render became permanent. Conversion now always targets a private empty temp
  dir, a non-zero exit is fatal, and the out-dir cleanup runs only after the PDF is verified readable.
- **The old-style font blacklist was factually wrong.** Measured from the installed fonts: Palatino
  digit top-spread 2/100pt, Baskerville 2 — both *lining*, both wrongly blocked. Replaced the list
  with measurement. (The list had been copied from the skill's own prose without checking it.)
- **The gate inverted on CJK:** `_digit_share` divided by raw character count, so `"2026 Roadmap"`
  scored 0.36 (warn) while `"2026 年路线图"` scored 0.50 (build failure) — Chinese decks did not get
  the carve-out SKILL.md promises. Now weighted by visual width, with the threshold re-measured into
  the empty gap between word-bearing headings (≤0.40) and real display numerals (≥0.67).
- **`_font_file` shadowing:** the numeral resolver was overridden by matplotlib's same-named helper
  later in the module, so "measured" detection actually measured DejaVu for every uninstalled face —
  on a host without Georgia the rule was silently dead.
- Four lint checks were firing on correct design, all reproduced before and after: `FOOTER-ZONE`
  judged the declared frame instead of the rendered ink; `CROWDED` counted a hero photograph's area
  as reading density; `INVERTED TYPE` fired on every interior statement slide (a ≤12-word largest run
  is the hero line, not a broken hierarchy); and `OVERLAP` flagged small textless markers riding a
  line or ring — composition, not collision, and 13 of one deck's 24 standing findings.
- **`position_map` hero labels are bound to their dot** — the hero claims its slot before the greedy
  anti-collision pass, and its label takes the dot's own hue. Found by building a real deck: the hero
  point's label had been nudged next to a *different* dot and read as that dot's subtitle. Bold alone
  says "important"; it does not say "belongs to THAT one".
- `_slide_fingerprints` re-hashed shared media once per referencing slide (40-slide deck sharing one
  plate: **318ms → 35ms** via part memoization); the subset temp dir leaked on every failure path.

## [3.6.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added — `OLDSTYLE_FIGURES`: a documented rule becomes a deterministic gate
- **`deckkit.lint_layout` now hard-fails on display numerals set in an OLD-STYLE (text) figure
  face** — Georgia, Palatino, Baskerville, Book Antiqua, Constantia, Hoefler Text, Calluna, Candara.
  Those faces set 0/1/2 at x-height, push 6/8 up and drop 3/4/5/7/9 below the baseline, so a hero
  number visibly bobs and misaligns with adjacent CJK/Latin. The check names the face, the offending
  run and its size, and points at the lining-figure fix.
- **Threshold-aware, so it is right rather than merely strict:** fires at **≥20pt** only. Old-style
  figures inside running prose are a legitimate typographic choice and stay quiet; the gate targets
  display numerals, where the wobble is a defect.
- **Why this shipped as code and not more prose:** the rule was already written in *five* places —
  `SKILL.md`, `design-principles.md`, `font-guidance.md`, `multilingual.md` and `critic.md` — and was
  still missed on a real deck, twice, across two skills. That is precisely the failure mode SKILL.md's
  own enforcement invariant warns about: *a MUST that lives only in reference prose is advisory in
  practice*. Geometry linters cannot see it (it is a font property, not a layout fault) and render
  thumbnails are too small to reveal it, so nothing downstream caught it either.
- Wired end-to-end: the CRITICAL in `lint_layout`, a plain-language row in `troubleshooting-faq.md` §4,
  the hard-fail list in `SKILL.md` updated from four items to five, and a **four-case regression test**
  in `smoke_deckkit.py` covering both directions (Georgia/Palatino display numerals fail; Georgia body
  prose and a lining-face numeral pass) — so the gate itself is verified to fire, not merely present.


### Added — composition / target / range components (native, editable)
- **`native_chart` stacked & area kinds** — `column_stacked` · `column_stacked_100` · `bar_stacked` ·
  `bar_stacked_100` · `area` · `area_stacked` · `area_stacked_100`: real editable PowerPoint charts for
  **composition over time** (a total AND its component mix — the most common exec chart the roster
  couldn't draw). Series-fill themed, `zero_base` extended to stacked column/bar, CJK `<a:ea>` labels
  intact; a printed notice fires on negative segments (a stack's height only reads as a sum for
  same-sign parts).
- **`deckkit.bullet_graph`** — Stephen Few's 'actual vs TARGET, in context' KPI bar (poor/ok/good bands +
  a target tick), one row per metric. Each row scales to its OWN max, so a **mixed-unit dashboard** reads
  right; `higher_better=False` reverses the bands for churn/latency. The dashboard bar `scorecard`/
  `meter_bar` can't give.
- **`deckkit.range_bars`** — a 'football field' (floating min–max ranges per row on a shared `axis_scale`
  + optional base-case tick); closes form-selection's recipe-only note.
- Wired end-to-end from a 4-lane self-check (integration · decision-taste · **agent-workflow cooperation**
  · correctness): a Composition + Range row in the Concept→Visualization dictionary (§3), a
  'stacked chart that misleads' anti-pattern (100%-hides-collapsing-total · negative segments · spaghetti)
  in `data-viz.md` + critic hooks in `review-rubrics.md`/`critic.md`, a single-highlight **carve-out** so a
  correct stacked chart isn't flagged, and roster/catalogue entries (`form-selection.md`, `data-viz.md`,
  `design-gallery.md`, `SKILL.md`). Correctness fixes: range_bars includes base-case points in its axis;
  bullet_graph sorts bands; smoke test added.

### Added — choropleth map (value per country / province)
- **`deckkit.choropleth(slide, x, y, w, h, data, mapname)`** + **`scripts/maps.py`** — the high-payoff
  form the skill was missing: shade a real map by a value per region. `mapname` = `europe` · `world` ·
  `china` (provinces). Built on **public-domain geometry** (Natural Earth 110m countries · DataV China
  provinces — nothing fabricated), rendered with matplotlib (no geopandas): Albers equal-area conic for a
  region, equirectangular for the world; light→`accent` ramp (or `scale='div'`); neutral no-data fill;
  thin borders. Key `data` by ISO-3166 alpha-2/alpha-3 or English name (countries), or province name/adcode
  (china); the Natural Earth `ISO_A2 = -99` quirk is patched (France/Norway…) and unmatched keys are
  reported, not dropped.
- The map PNG is **language-agnostic**; the title + gradient legend are **native deckkit text**, so units
  and titles render in any language (CJK included) instead of matplotlib tofu. Geometry is fetched once and
  cached like icons (network only on first use; `SLIDE_MAKER_CACHE` override).
- Hardened by a 3-lane self-check (code-alignment · decision-taste · adversarial correctness): `scale='div'`
  is **zero-centred** (neutral == 0, distinct poles via `accent2`) and the native legend now renders the
  diverging ramp with a 0 tick so **legend and map agree**; NaN/None values are treated as no-data (no
  crash); the unmatched-key notice reports the **actual** bad keys; China's **nine-dash line** renders as a
  visible dashed element. Decision-taste wired everywhere the model looks: a **Geography/"where"** row in the
  Concept→Visualization dictionary (`design-intelligence-addendum.md` §3 + `form-selection.md`), a
  **counts-not-rates** anti-pattern in `data-viz.md` + a named critic check in `review-rubrics.md`, and the
  "shade a rate, blank = no data" guidance in the docstring. Smoke covers projection, region matching
  (incl. the -99 patch), NaN, div, and a real render.

### Security — hardening pass (public-skill audit)
- **SVG icon rasterizer no longer executes untrusted content (was the one real vuln).** `icon_png()`
  accepts a local `.svg`, and when `cairosvg`/`rsvg-convert` are absent the headless-Chrome fallback
  used to render it with JS + `file://` access — an attacker-supplied icon could read local files
  (exfiltrated into the deck) or run JS/SSRF. Fixed with `sanitize_svg()` (a backend-agnostic control
  run before every rasterizer): strips `<script>`/`<foreignObject>`/`<iframe>`/`<image>`/`<audio>`/
  `<video>`/`<set>`/`<animate>` (incl. namespaced forms), `on*` handlers, any non-internal
  `href`/`xlink:href`/`src`, and external `url(...)` — while preserving paths, `<use href="#..">`, and
  the gradient refs recolor injects. Chrome also runs `--disable-remote-fonts`. Comments are stripped
  first (no comment-split reassembly), and the input is size/complexity-bounded (>100KB or >600 elements
  is refused in ~1ms) so the sanitizer itself can't be turned into a quadratic-time DoS. Verified across
  all 13 icon libraries: real icons (flat + gradient + duotone) still render; a 16-payload adversarial
  battery is fully neutralized; a ReDoS regression test guards the bound (`smoke_deckkit.py`).
- **Icon `name` is validated** (`fetch_svg`) as a strict slug (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, no `..`), closing a
  path-traversal into the icon cache and a CDN-URL traversal to arbitrary jsDelivr/npm packages.
- **LibreOffice render is now time-bounded** (`render_deck.py`, `timeout=300`) so a malformed/hostile
  `.pptx` can't hang the pipeline — matching the timeouts every other soffice/ffmpeg call already had.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added — connectors dock on block edges (arrows never emerge from a block's centre)
- **`edge_point(rect, toward)`** — the point where a line aimed at `toward` crosses a block's
  boundary; the primitive behind edge-docked arrows (optional `inset` for a standoff).
- **`connect_boxes(a, b)` / `hub_spokes(hub, spokes)`** — connectors that dock on the facing EDGES
  of two block rects, so BOTH ends land on a boundary and nothing crosses a block's own label. The
  ergonomic replacement for hand-computing a centre point (the `hub_spokes` fan is exactly the
  "one Gateway, everything connects to it" topology shape).
- **`CONNECTOR_IN_BOX` build-time lint** — flags an arrow/line endpoint sitting in a block's central
  zone AND drawn above that block (so the stroke shows crossing the interior). Central-zone + z-order
  test keeps it false-positive-free: edge-docked ends, chart grid/axis lines, and the covered pattern
  (connector added before the node) never trip it. New `smoke_deckkit.py` case
  ("lint_layout CONNECTOR_IN_BOX") locks in the behaviour. Wired into `slide-design.md` (diagram
  self-verify), `design-gallery.md` (diagram crib), and `troubleshooting-faq.md` (§4).

### Added — overflow-proof components (by construction, not by lint)
- **`meter_bar`** measures the value label's real width, clamps the value box to it, and shortens
  the BAR when the footprint would leave the canvas (printed note; impossible fits raise) — the
  recurring right-edge `OFF_CANVAS` bug is now unrepresentable.
- **`scorecard`** measures the caption's wrapped height (instead of assuming 0.40in) and adapts —
  value shrinks first, then the caption steps down to an 8.5pt floor — so captions no longer run
  past the card bottom.
- **`insight_banner`** measures its body: a too-long body drops one size step, then the bar GROWS
  to hold it — text never escapes the shape.
- **`stat_row`** never wraps a figure mid-number (over-wide figures scale down, floor 15pt),
  measures caption heights, and returns the real bottom y.
- All four are **byte-identical on fitting calls** — only an overflowing call is adjusted; the four
  real-world failure shapes from this week's decks are now a permanent smoke-test case
  (`smoke_deckkit.py` "overflow-proof components"), verified clean at build-time AND render-time lint.

### Added — free-win deliverables & speed (multi-platform: identical on Claude Code / Codex / Windows)
- **PDF as a first-class deliverable** — the render pipeline already produces a PDF as its first
  step; `render_deck.py` now parks it beside the `.pptx` (`<deck>.pdf`) instead of burying it in
  `render/` — submission/email/print-ready at zero extra cost.
- **`viewer.html`** — a self-contained, zero-dependency flip-through preview generated on every
  render and **parked at the deck root beside the `.pptx`/`.pdf`** (not buried in `render/`; it
  references the PNGs through the `render/` subdir): one `file://` link, any browser, any OS (arrow
  keys / click / thumbnail rail / fullscreen). The fastest way to eyeball a deck without opening PowerPoint.
- **Persistent host-agnostic icon cache** — icon SVGs now cache in the platform cache dir
  (macOS `~/Library/Caches/slide-maker/icons` · Linux `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` · Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%`,
  override `SLIDE_MAKER_CACHE`) instead of `/tmp` — shared across Claude Code AND Codex on the same
  machine, fetched once ever, and warm builds work offline. Hardened by an adversarial audit:
  atomic cache writes + self-healing torn entries, unwritable-cache fallback to tmp, and
  `check_env.py` now prints the active cache path.
- **`render_deck` out-dir safety** — the pre-existing `rmtree(out)` could wipe a user directory
  (passing `.` as out deleted the pptx itself); now the dir is only removed when it holds nothing
  but this deck's own render products (OS junk tolerated, `.git`/foreign PDFs route to a safe
  per-file clean). Special-character deck names (spaces/中文/&) verified; viewer title HTML-escaped;
  preview link is a proper `file:///` URI via `Path.as_uri()`. Docs synced (handoff-and-iteration's
  stale "PDF on request", FAQ §5 pipeline products, large-deck section-PDF cleanup, icons.md cache note).

### Fixed — ZH/EN system consistency (from a 2-round bilingual audit incl. a live CJK build test)
- **`presets.py` KaiTi platform bug** — `ink_wash`/`eastern_traditional` hardcoded `"KaiTi"`, a family
  name that does not exist on macOS (it's `"Kaiti SC"`); the ink presets' calligraphic titles rode an
  uncontrolled font substitution. Now resolved per platform via `_KAITI`; `east-asian-aesthetic.md`
  corrected (it claimed the reverse of `multilingual.md`'s correct table) and its PingFang body
  recommendation now carries the render-loop-trap caveat. Also repaired a docstring line that had
  split `from presets import preset` in half.
- **`wordmark()` CJK tofu** — a Chinese entity name resolved to a Latin face with no CJK cmap and the
  deck's sanctioned logo stand-in shipped as tofu chrome (verified). Now CJK-aware:
  font → EADISPLAY → EAFONT → a CJK-capable system face; documented in `multilingual.md` +
  `image-generation.md`.
- **`native_chart` CJK labels uncontrolled** — python-pptx writes font names into `<a:latin>` only,
  so chart category/series labels (一月/营收) fell back to the theme's EA default. `_theme_chart` now
  writes `<a:ea>` into every chartSpace `defRPr` (verified in the XML).
- **New build-time gate `CJK_NO_EA`** — CJK runs with no `<a:ea>` font now fail `lint_layout`
  (CRITICAL) at build time instead of only after the render round-trip; `lint_deck` stays as the
  backstop. FAQ §4 row added; SKILL.md's lint classifications updated.
- **`extract_pdf._load` aligned byte-for-byte with `lint_deck._text_load`** — CJK punctuation
  handling, ASCII-punctuation splits and rounding had drifted (~19% heavier on Chinese prose), so
  Chinese PDFs crossed long-source thresholds earlier than equivalent English ones (verified equal
  on mixed samples now).
- Checkpoint-table headers: documented that they follow the conversation language (the 中文 column
  names in SKILL.md are not fixed for English decks). FAQ: added the `PINGFANG ON MACOS` row and
  named `CJK TIGHT LEADING` in its row. README EN/CN micro-drifts aligned (fraction/matrix fallback
  wording, 独立复核, structured analysis, interview tab labels).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added — multi-format source ingestion (Word · Excel · image · audio · video · cloud)
- The content-planner (`agents/content-planner.md` §1 "Input formats") now has an explicit ingest
  route + fidelity floor per source type: **Word `.docx`** (`ingest.py doctext` exact text+tables;
  long docs → `office`→PDF for long-source triage); **`.pptx`** → `extract_deck.py` (native);
  **Excel `.xlsx`** → `ingest.py sheet` (exact CSV rows; office→PDF drops data); **images** (place the
  pixels as a figure freely, but a number/quote *typed* off one is `verified? = N` until confirmed —
  no OCR); **video** (supplied transcript = precise spoken content; else `frames` samples the visual
  track and the narration is a flagged GAP — never invented); **audio-only** and **cloud docs
  (Google/Notion/URL)** get honest "supply a transcript / export the file" guidance.
- `scripts/ingest.py` — `probe` (detect + route), `doctext` (python-docx), `sheet` (openpyxl → CSV),
  `office` (LibreOffice → PDF; isolated temp profile, no litter), `frames` (ffmpeg keyframes, **capped
  at 60**, refuses audio-only files, honest "no STT" warning); clean errors + exit codes on every bad
  input; arg parsing hardened.
- **Fidelity mirror (both sides wired):** the planner routes pixel/audio-sourced claims through the
  claim ledger as `verified? = N` (with image/frame/transcript `source` tokens), AND the critic now
  enforces it — `references/review-rubrics.md` item 10 + `agents/critic.md` flag a number typed off an
  unverifiable image (blocker → show as a trend) and a video's reconstructed narration dressed as fact
  (major). Re-reading the same pixels is not confirmation.
- Wiring: Step-0 source question lists the formats + dedicated routes (uncrossed); nav-table + Files
  inventory list `ingest.py`.

### Changed / Fixed — holistic integration hardening (from a whole-delta 4-lens audit)
- **The CONTRACT CARD now carries the new artifacts** in all three enumerations (SKILL.md assembly ·
  critic.md · arbiter.md): the `source size:` line + the approved Source-coverage map on a long-source
  deck (critics judge completeness against its built-around/summarised set, never the whole book) and
  the transcript status on a video-sourced deck — closing the gap where the rubric told the critic to
  judge against an artifact it was never given.
- **Two-phase planner dispatch for over-threshold sources** — phase 1 (classify+map+triage) returns the
  draft coverage map, the coordinator posts the selection FYI and confirms the slice, phase 2 runs the
  verbatim deep-read; recorded as a `selection FYI:` plan line the checkpoint checks (a one-shot
  dispatch silently made the "early" FYI post-hoc).
- **`source size:` is now required for EVERY file-sourced deck** (not just self-declared long ones) —
  the bounded-vs-long classification is a recorded measurement; its absence blocks the plan (the gate
  was self-referential before: only sources already judged "long" ever got measured).
- **Arbiter wired into the fidelity mirror** — a pixel/audio-sourced ledger row cannot be confirmed by
  re-reading the pixels; absent an underlying-data/transcript locator the critic's finding is real
  (an arbiter following the old text could overturn a correct blocker).
- **Video gate** — a video-sourced plan must carry the transcript-status line (supplied locator or the
  visual-only GAP line), checked at the §1 self-verify + checkpoint + digest; supplied-transcript rows
  verify like text (they were wrongly pinned to `verified? = N`); pixel rows become shippable by
  appending the underlying-data locator and flipping to Y.
- **Stale re-key fixed** — the CONTENT-checkpoint precondition still gated "every `map` TOC chapter"
  (vacuous on a no-TOC book); now "every skeleton section" like everywhere else. CJK caveat on the
  `wc -w` fallback (undercounts ~6–30×); mixed-format multi-file sets convert non-PDF members to PDF;
  page-scoped figure locators on long sources (never whole-book `autofig`).
- **Tooling** — `ingest.py doctext` now extracts textboxes + headers/footers and warns on
  footnotes/endnotes (was silently dropping them while claiming "exact"); `sheet` warns when formula
  cells have no cached value (blank ≠ absent) and emits pure dates; `office` converts into a fresh
  temp dir + checks the exit code (a stale same-name PDF could masquerade as a fresh conversion);
  `extract_pdf.py headings` falls back to bold/ALL-CAPS candidates when a book has no font-size
  outliers; `map`'s no-TOC hint points at `headings`; EPUB no longer warned against (it's a
  documented route).
- **troubleshooting-faq.md §11** — symptom → cause → fix for every new ingestion/long-source error
  surface (the FAQ's "any failure" promise held again); `requirements.txt` lists the optional
  ingestion deps (python-docx · openpyxl · ffmpeg).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Long-source mode** — the content-planner (`agents/content-planner.md` §1) now handles a **book
  or very long PDF** without faking a linear read (which either overflows context or, worse, fits
  and goes shallow, then fabricates plausible-but-absent points). The method: anchor on the deck's
  purpose first (importance is purpose-relative) → **map** the structure → read chapter-by-chapter
  into page-tagged notes (map-reduce; fan out the *reading*, synthesise as one mind) → **deep-read
  verbatim only the load-bearing ~20%** for slide-bound claims → trace every claim to a real page (a
  chapter note is corroboration, not a source). The plan gains a required **Source-coverage map**
  (each chapter → built-around / summarised / cut) so the SELECTION is explicit — the coverage gate
  at book scale — and it is confirmed at the CONTENT checkpoint (surfaced even under the auto-waiver,
  since the wrong-slice risk is the biggest one on a book). Honest limits are named: a scanned /
  image-only or DRM-locked PDF yields no text → ask for a text version / OCR / specific chapters.
- `scripts/extract_pdf.py` gains two long-source commands: **`map`** (structural skeleton — page/word/
  token estimate + the embedded TOC/bookmarks + a binned word-density strip, no body text) and
  **`text`** (dump a 1-indexed inclusive page range with PAGE markers, for chunked reading).
- SKILL.md wiring: a long-source case in Step 1, the Source-coverage/SELECTION gate on the CONTENT
  checkpoint, and nav-table + Files rows pointing at the mode and its tooling.

### Robustness — non-PDF · multi-file · no-TOC · CJK · graceful tooling (hardened from a 4-lens adversarial audit)
- **Non-PDF & multi-file sources** — the mode no longer assumes a single PDF. Step 0 classifies by
  type: PDF/EPUB via `extract_pdf.py map`; `.docx`/`.md`/Google-Doc/web → convert or a `wc`-style
  count; a code repo → size the file tree; **multi-file/multi-volume → sum pages/tokens across
  files**, with per-file coverage rows and `<file>:p.NNN` provenance cites.
- **No-TOC books genuinely gated** — the Source-coverage gate is re-keyed from "every `map` TOC
  chapter" to "every **skeleton** section (TOC *or* a recorded reconstructed skeleton)", so a no-TOC
  book can't pass vacuously; new `extract_pdf.py headings` reconstructs the skeleton by font-size
  outlier (no whole-book read).
- **CJK sizing fixed** — `map`/`text` used `.split()`, undercounting Chinese/Japanese/Korean 10-30×
  so a dense CJK book evaded the token trigger; now a CJK-aware load (`latin words + CJK chars / 2`).
- **Reading budgeted** — only `built-around`/`summarised` chapters are read; `cut` chapters are
  dispositioned from the skeleton unread; verbatim stays ~20% with a total ceiling; figures extracted
  per page from the plan's locators, never `autofig` over the whole book.
- **`extract_pdf.py` fails gracefully** — `_open` catches missing/corrupt/unopenable files (clean
  message + exit 1, no traceback) and flags a non-PDF; `map` warns on scanned PDFs; `text` counts
  body-only (excludes PAGE markers), rejects bad ranges, writes UTF-8; arg parsing prints usage, not
  tracebacks.
- **Critic rubric mirrors the planner** — `review-rubrics.md` item 10 widened: PROVENANCE covers
  book-page claims (a chapter-note-only "fact" = unverified), COVERAGE judged against the approved
  Source-coverage map's built-around/summarised set.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Boldness dial + signature-move distinctiveness axis** — the design plan now carries a
  two-line aesthetic-risk contract. `boldness: <conservative | balanced+ | bold | experimental>`
  sets how many beats may carry risk and how far the deck's ONE required `signature move` pushes
  (precedence: explicit user request > `taste.md`'s promoted dial > purpose-derived default;
  `balanced+` = exactly one genuine signature move). A pre-commit web pass for 2–3 genuinely
  distinctive references raises the ceiling before the move is fixed. Wired through
  `agents/slide-design.md` (contract + reference pass), `agents/critic.md` and
  `references/review-rubrics.md` (a distinctiveness lens that flags template-competent-but-timid
  work), `agents/arbiter.md`, `references/user-taste.md` (the dial is a promotable taste
  dimension), `references/large-deck-orchestration.md`, and SKILL.md.
- `scripts/smoke_deckkit.py` — a stdlib-only smoke test covering gradient-stop normalization
  (both shorthand and full-stop forms; the RGBColor-is-tuple parse guard) and the icon_tile
  contrast guard.
- Install channels: **SkillHub** and **Coze** added to `README.md` / `README_CN.md` alongside
  the existing `npx skills add` / marketplace paths.

### Changed
- The 3:4 social format is named **rednote** (小红书's English name) across `scripts/formats.py`
  and `references/canvas-formats.md`.

### Fixed
- `deckkit.icon_tile` guarantees glyph↔tile contrast **by construction**: when the glyph's ink
  is known (declared, or inferred from the PNG via `_png_dominant_ink`), the tile fill is
  auto-nudged to keep the pair ≥3:1 — a low-contrast icon-on-tile is now impossible rather than
  merely flagged after render.
- `deckkit._norm_stops` parses `(c0, c1)` shorthand, `(pos, colour)` pairs, and full
  `(pos, colour, alpha)` stop-lists uniformly, closing an RGBColor-looks-like-a-tuple ambiguity
  in gradient fills.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Canvas formats** — `scripts/formats.py`, a named canvas-format registry (16:9 default ·
  4:3 · square 1:1 · 小红书 3:4 · story 9:16 · A4 print) with per-format dimensions,
  platform-UI safe zones, chrome policy, density guidance, lint flags, and a `band()`
  safe-content-rect helper (safe zones + footer reserve). Opt-in: the 16:9 default path
  never touches it, and all deckkit components carry over unchanged.
- `references/canvas-formats.md` — per-surface layout DNA, the inch-normalization sizing
  principle, the repurpose/batch pattern (one content plan → several surfaces), and three
  **verified layout patterns** (band-driven pitch distribution · closing element anchored
  at the band bottom · MIDDLE-anchored clusters) proven by a 6-format visual-verification
  pass (2 judge rounds per format, all-pass).
- SKILL.md wiring: the interview confirms the canvas format only for non-talk deliverables
  (social card / print); Step 3 documents the `formats.py` build path.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), backfilled from the GitHub releases.
- `scripts/validate_review.py` — stdlib-only validator for the critic/arbiter review-JSON
  contracts (`python3 validate_review.py critic|arbiter <file|->`), with a `--selftest`.
- CI: a step asserting `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` versions match, and a
  `validate_review.py --selftest` step.

### Changed
- Hardened gates from live-deck feedback: sourced-photo **aesthetic vetting** (+ a
  `searched, found but low-quality → generated, flagged illustrative` rung), title-over-hero
  legibility (a scrim only dims a bright frame-line — cover linework with a near-opaque
  panel; clear title↔subtitle gap), semantic-colour **text vs fill** two-token contrast rule
  (text ≥4.5:1), block text centered by construction, and rotating title-chrome treatments
  (2–3 per deck) so the title band never reads as one fixed template.

### Fixed
- `deckkit.part_eyebrow` default width (6.0in) now clamps to the real canvas, so eyebrows
  never overflow narrow (story/portrait) decks — found by the canvas-format verification;
  byte-identical on standard 16:9 calls.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version aligned to the marketplace manifest (3.0.0 → 3.0.1).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- `references/troubleshooting-faq.md` — ten sections, every entry the same shape: the
  exact message you see → plain-language cause → first fix (error surfaces, env/install,
  build-time exceptions, both lint code dictionaries, render failures, `[stats]`
  guidance, image generation/sourcing, CJK, FAQ one-liners).

### Changed
- Error messages carry their fix inline: `OFF_CANVAS` / `OVERLAP` / canvas-`OVERFLOW`
  gained "→ how to fix" tails; failing lint runs print a pointer to the FAQ's matching
  section. `--json` output and exit codes stay byte-compatible.
- SKILL.md wiring: consult the FAQ before improvising a fix; report findings to the user
  in plain language, never as raw lint codes; both READMEs link the page.

### Fixed
- Five blockers from a 3-auditor adversarial pass fixed pre-ship (FAQ render section
  rewritten against the real `render_deck.py` pipeline; canvas-size and CJK line-spacing
  corrections).
- `lint_deck.py` no longer crashes on a 0-slide deck with an empty auto-discovered
  render dir.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Identity-propagation contract**: a generated visual identity now propagates through
  all three layers of the deck — a type register derived from the image's character
  (8-family mapping with install-safe fallbacks), component geometry read off the image
  (outline weight · corner language · shadow/depth · fill flatness), and a four-line
  contract (palette · type · geometry · surface) recorded in the plan, shown at the hero
  checkpoint, and enforced by a new "identity-propagation break" critic finding.
- **Provenance contract** (planner MUST): a web-sourced load-bearing claim needs a
  primary source in the claim ledger; spliced figures and quote-mark abuse are named and
  banned.
- **Primary-source gate** before hand-off: independent verifiers with live web access
  try to refute every headline claim; the hand-off carries a `provenance:` tally line.
- Critic/rubric wiring: primary-source provenance (blocker), spliced figures (major),
  quote-mark abuse (major).
- deckkit: `sources_page` gains a `rule` param to suppress the accent hairline.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Design intelligence mined from JimLiu/baoyu-skills: 60 candidates audited, 12 adopted
  and hardened by a 3-auditor verification round.
- **Preset guards** — 1–3 countable register rules per preset, enforced plan → contract
  card → critic "REGISTER BREAK" → PRE-FLIGHT; an explicit user request lifts them as a
  named deviation.
- Diagram craft: layer-first system-architecture and happy-path flowchart recipes,
  complexity-escalation thresholds, z-order assembly guidance.
- deckkit: `diamond`/`parallelogram`/`cylinder` node shapes + connector `head` styles
  (defaults byte-identical).
- Quantified mood dial (subtle/balanced/bold), metaphor→concept rule, CJK ~1.7–2× width
  contract + new CJK pairing rows, typed dense-modules for read-alone surfaces.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **REFERENT RULE**: a real-and-specific subject gets a license-clear sourced photo —
  generation claiming photographic reality of a real referent is a fidelity bug on every
  template branch; a declared stylized register is the sanctioned illustration escape.
- Sourced-photo pipeline: sanctioned origins → subject verification → license + credit →
  palette treatment → per-row evidence tokens; ownership chain wired through
  slide-design, the main loop, and asset-prep, gated at self-verify / PRE-FLIGHT /
  checkpoint / critic.
- **Watermark gate**: a watermarked file is rejected and replaced, never
  cropped/blurred/inpainted to hide the mark.

### Changed
- 21-finding alignment sweep bringing `critic.md` fully to v2.6/v2.7 terms.
- Design hardening from a real fix-pass: "mute the HUE, not the VALUE", measured numeral
  stacks, and a 7-rule surgical fix-pass protocol for copy-in-place edits on foreign
  decks.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **STRANGER TEST for motifs**: a signature device must be legible to a first-time
  viewer — labeled at first appearance, figurative, or paired with an on-canvas legend;
  the checkpoint motif line states device + meaning + legibility mode.
- **LOGO PRINCIPLE** as a situation table with mandatory evidence tokens on the
  `logo plan:` line (`official asset — <source>` / `searched, none found → wordmark
  (flagged)` / `n/a — <reason>`).
- Enforcement wiring for both: design self-verify (n)/(o), PRE-FLIGHT 3(c), and new
  "opaque motif" and "logo missing or unevidenced" critic findings.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Icons are no longer optional on category/entity-rich content — enforced at
  self-verify (g), PRE-FLIGHT 12(e), the critic rubric, and the generated-template
  checklist.
- **Architecture rotation**: repeat the SYSTEM (palette/type/chrome), vary the
  ARCHITECTURE (takeaway slot ≤ ~half the deck per slot; ≥1/3 of protagonists
  direct-on-canvas).
- New lints: `BOTTOM-STRIP MONOCULTURE`, `STRETCHED THIN`, `DEAD BOTTOM`,
  `ONE-OFF CANVAS FLIP`; per-slide JSON exports `n_pic_fg` / `content_bottom` /
  `col_void`.
- Content-planner DISTRIBUTE pass + a `units` column on the content checkpoint table.

### Fixed
- `UNDERFILLED` no longer disabled by a full-bleed background plate — only substantial
  foreground imagery earns whitespace.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Anti-greedy design gates**: divergent form choice (each slide names a runner-up from
  a different form family), a literal PRE-FLIGHT form-family tally, new `CARD DOMINANCE`
  and `UNDERFILLED` lint warns, and a content-planner frame-fill/merge check.
- **Style-first generated-template gate**: three deliberately diverse visual languages
  shown as real generated candidate images in one HTML gallery; the winner's image is
  reused as the deck's hero.
- Style library broadened to ~40 styles across 8 families, grounded in a web sweep of
  current design taxonomies.
- Topical whole-deck backgrounds: every main-content slide's generated background must
  carry the deck's own subject motifs — never generic texture.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Robustness audit: 34 issues fixed from a two-arm audit (5 real decks built + a static
  audit), all render-verified. Headline fix: wrapping titles are no longer struck
  through by the accent rule (`title_bar`/`cover`/`colophon`/`editorial_header` measure
  the wrapped title).
- Theming propagation: `deckkit` fonts/palette now resolve at call time; new
  `deckkit.set_palette(...)` re-themes the whole component set in one call.
- Provable ≥4.5:1 contrast on seven components; auto-fit/overflow fixes on `scorecard`,
  `segmented_bar`, `pull_quote`, `table`.
- Data honesty & i18n: `_numlabel` kills scientific notation, `dumbbell_board(regress=)`
  recolours regressions to risk red, ASCII minus in `waterfall`, i18n label params on
  `eval_matrix`/`colophon`, `hub_spoke` collision guard.

### Added
- New lints: `META-ANNOTATION LEAK`, `INVERTED TYPE HIERARCHY`, `LOPSIDED`, and
  grey-on-white contrast.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Value-encoding fidelity patch — the geometry now matches the number:
  `native_chart`/`native_pareto` columns pin the value axis to 0 by default;
  `tier_stack`/`funnel` widths track `value/max` with only a hairline floor (side leader
  for too-thin bands); `heat_matrix(scale='div')` zero-centres its neutral.

### Changed
- The root cause generalized into `data-viz.md`, `design-principles.md`, a critic
  value-encoding spot-check, and the SKILL render self-check ("Geometry matches the
  number"); every other value-encoding component audited faithful.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Appear-builds are the user's opt-in, and once a slide animates the reveal is fully
  staged — nothing pre-shown but the title/frame (fixes the half-animated-slide bug).
- Six new components: `tier_stack`, `gantt`, `waterfall`, `eval_matrix` +
  `harvey_ball`, `heat_matrix`, `device_frame`; ten Tier-2 compose-from-primitives
  recipes.
- Background & cover taste rules: harmonised background zones, topical covers even on
  flat templates, varied canvas value dosed like the WOW.

### Changed
- Complete scenario → component routing audited against the full inventory.
- "You decide" derives, it doesn't default; README repositioned around the real moat.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Contract card** handed to critic/arbiter (deck message, takeaway/role/question/beat
  table, claim ledger, carrying elements, declared design contracts); the critic emits a
  `plan_audit`.
- **Spoken thread**: the planner authors the per-slide talk track, piped verbatim into
  speaker notes; lint counts it (NO NOTES warn).
- Money slide, takeaway spine test, plan-time word-budget check, assertion-title
  binding, evidence manifest, recorded fresh-eyes probes, do-not-harm strengths ledger,
  and a one-line ceiling on every consent.
- **Portable taste profile** (`taste.md`): durable cross-deck preferences you own —
  seeds defaults, never overrides the current deck.
- deckkit `axis_scale` / `dot_strip` / `pangu()`; new advisory lints `SKELETON VARIETY`,
  `TIMID COVER`, `FLAT RHYTHM` + bookend thumbnails for the poster test.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **The taste layer**: TASTE PROTOCOL (judge like a person, then check like a machine),
  editor's stance + COVERAGE GATE in the content-planner, art director's stance
  (blank-canvas sketch first, catalogue second).
- New components: `kpi_card`, `flow_compare`, `cycle_diagram`, `dumbbell_board`,
  `icon_chip`, `conclusion_strip`, `tint()`.
- lint: `--json` structured output, `--surface`, `--textheavy`; critic findings ordered
  by leverage; arbiter escalation escape hatch.

### Changed
- Interview & pipeline hardening from a 5-slice adversarial audit (11 verified
  conflicts/gaps fixed); standard mode vs per-deck AUTO WAIVER separated; returning-user
  history rolls up to one option; checkpoints are compact in-chat tables.
- READMEs (EN+CN) realigned to the full agent roster and two-checkpoint flow.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- Initial public release: a paper, repo, doc, or topic becomes a native, editable
  PowerPoint — real text boxes, native charts, editable formulas, speaker notes, and
  click-build reveals — planned, built, and independently reviewed by a team of agents
  (content-planner, critic, arbiter, asset-prep).
- One-line install straight from `main`: `npx skills add addsumtech/slides_maker`; the
  demo site + template gallery moved to `slides_maker-site` (slides.addsum.top).
- Deterministic layout lint catches invisible / low-contrast dark-on-dark text;
  bilingual README + 8-direction template gallery.
